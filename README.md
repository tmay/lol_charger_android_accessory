lol_charger_android_accessory
=============================

Source code for the lolcharger Android Accessory.
The lolcharger is a combination of:
* the LOL Sheild kit ( http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/lolshield/ )
* Android Acessory Development Kit ( http://developer.android.com/tools/adk/index.html )

These kits were put together to build a simple accessory that I could use in a presentation.
The lolcharger connects to your Anroid device and provides enough current to charge the battery,
but also hosts a lolshield ( lots of leds ) to display strings sent from the phone.  The Batteries
charge percentage is also updated whenever the value changes.

This is all a work in progress.

The roadmap ahead:
* move all the open acessory handling code into a service
* implement AOA 2.0 protocal to support the FT311D Android USB chip
